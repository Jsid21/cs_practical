### **Step 0: Install Nmap (if not already installed)**

🧠 **Why?**

Ubuntu may not have Nmap installed by default.

💻 **Command:**

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap -y
```

### 🔹 **Step 1: Find Your IP Address and Network Range**

🧠 **Why?**

You need the subnet (like `192.168.1.0/24`) to scan the entire local network.

💻 **Command:**

```

```

Perfect — here’s a clean and **practical-focused progression of Nmap commands**, starting from **basic to intermediate**, with **short, to-the-point explanations** for each.

# 🛠️ Nmap Command Guide (Basic → Intermediate)

---

## 🟢 **Basic Level**

### 1. **Ping Scan – Find Live Hosts**

```bash
nmap -sn 10.0.2.0/24

```

> 🔍 Sends ICMP echo requests to all IPs in the subnet. Use to discover active (up) devices on the network.
> 

---

### 2. **Simple Port Scan**

```bash
nmap 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Scans default top 1000 TCP ports on the target IP. Use to find open ports quickly.
> 

---

### 3. **Scan Multiple IPs**

```bash
nmap 10.0.2.1 10.0.2.5 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Scans several specific hosts in one command.
> 

---

### 4. **Scan IP Range**

```bash
nmap 10.0.2.1-20

```

> 🔍 Scans all IPs from 10.0.2.1 to 10.0.2.20.
> 

---

### 5. **Scan Entire Subnet**

```bash
nmap 10.0.2.0/24

```

> 🔍 Scans all 256 IPs in the subnet, defaulting to port scan and host discovery.
> 

---

## 🟡 **Intermediate Level**

### 6. **Service and Version Detection**

```bash
nmap -sV 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Detects versions of services running on open ports. Helps identify vulnerabilities.
> 

---

### 7. **Aggressive Scan**

```bash
nmap -A 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Performs OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
> 

---

### 8. **Scan All Ports (1–65535)**

```bash
nmap -p- 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Scans every possible port, not just the top 1000. Slower but thorough.
> 

---

### 9. **Scan Specific Ports**

```bash
nmap -p 22,80,443 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Scans only selected ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
> 

---

### 10. **OS Detection**

```bash
nmap -O 10.0.2.15

```

> 🔍 Tries to detect the target's operating system based on TCP/IP stack behavior.
>
